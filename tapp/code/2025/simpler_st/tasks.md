## Pending Tasks (Report Gaps Identified by Technical Trader Review) - TODO

5.  **Issue:** Redundant output in Trade Log section. The `report_generator.py` currently writes out *both* a bolded key (`**Field:** Value`) and a plain key (`Field: Value`) for every single field within each trade log entry in the Markdown report. This significantly bloats the report and reduces readability.
    **Suggested Action:** Simplify the trade log output in `report_generator.py`. Choose one consistent format for displaying trade details (e.g., using the bolded key format or a Markdown table per trade) and remove the duplicate plain text lines.

6.  **Issue:** Potential off-by-one error in regime filtering. The `filter_regime_series` function within `report_generator.py` uses the condition `count > threshold` where `threshold = min_duration - 1` to decide if a regime duration is long enough to be included in the summary table. This means a regime lasting exactly `min_duration` days might be excluded.
    **Suggested Action:** Modify the condition in `report_generator.py::filter_regime_series` to `count >= min_duration` to correctly include regimes that meet the minimum duration exactly. Add a specific test case in `tests/test_report_generation.py` to verify this boundary condition.

7.  **Issue:** Inefficient/Duplicated Indicator Calculation. RSI calculation logic is duplicated within `tech_analysis/backtest.py::sma_crossover_backtest_with_log`. ATR calculation falls back to using standard deviation if high/low columns are missing, which isn't a standard or necessarily meaningful fallback for ATR.
    **Suggested Action:** Refactor indicator calculations. Ideally, calculate all required indicators (SMA, RSI, ATR, etc.) once per ticker DataFrame *before* passing the data to the backtesting simulation loop. Pass the DataFrame with pre-calculated indicators. Re-evaluate the ATR fallback logic; perhaps raise an error or use a different volatility measure if required columns are missing.

8.  **Issue:** Potential unused code. The `tech_analysis/backtest.py` file contains `sma_crossover_backtest` (the version without detailed logging) and `rsi_strategy_backtest`. Given the pipeline focuses on `sma_crossover_backtest_with_log` via `portfolio_backtest`, these other functions might be unused legacy code.
    **Suggested Action:** Verify if `sma_crossover_backtest` and `rsi_strategy_backtest` are still required. If not, remove them to simplify the codebase. If they serve a different purpose (e.g., unit testing, alternative strategy runs), ensure they are covered by tests or clearly documented.

9.  **Issue:** Insufficient test coverage for portfolio logic. Existing tests cover individual functions and report generation aspects well. However, there are no integration tests specifically validating the *portfolio-level* simulation logic (shared cash, cross-ticker decisions) as required by the PRD, mainly because this logic seems incorrectly implemented currently. Report generation tests also rely heavily on a `dummy_bt` object, which might mask issues related to the actual data structure passed by the pipeline.
    **Suggested Action:** Once Task #1 (Portfolio Simulation) is correctly implemented, add specific integration tests in `tests/test_backtest_engine.py` or `tests/test_pipeline.py` that verify the portfolio simulation behaves correctly over time with multiple tickers and shared resources. Update `tests/test_report_generation.py` to use mock `stats` dictionaries that more closely resemble the actual output of the pipeline, reducing reliance on the potentially misleading `dummy_bt` object.

10. **Issue:** Potentially misleading risk description. The "Risk and Position Sizing Logic" section in `report_generator.py` calculates `% Risked Per Trade` as `(position_size / initial_cash) * 100`. This is only accurate at the very start of the backtest. True risk per trade might vary depending on how `position_size` is interpreted (fixed value vs. % of current equity) in the actual (yet to be correctly implemented) portfolio simulation. The current description might oversimplify or misrepresent the actual risk taken later in the backtest.
    **Suggested Action:** Update the "Risk and Position Sizing Logic" section in `report_generator.py`. Clearly state how `position_size` is defined (e.g., "Fixed cash amount per trade," "Target % of initial capital," "Target % of current equity"). Avoid calculating and stating a fixed `% Risked Per Trade` if the actual risk varies based on the portfolio's evolution. Describe the *rule* used for sizing rather than just the initial percentage.

11. **Issue:** Hardcoded values in regime definitions. The narrative descriptions for "Trending" and "Ranging" regimes in the "Regime Summary" section of `report_generator.py` contain hardcoded window lengths (e.g., "window: 20", "window: 50") and duration ("more than 3 days"). While the parameters are listed separately below, the descriptive text itself is static.
    **Suggested Action:** Modify the narrative descriptions for regimes in `report_generator.py` to dynamically insert the actual parameter values (`short_window`, `long_window`, `min_regime_days`) from the `stats['strategy_params']` dictionary using f-strings. This ensures the description always matches the parameters used.

12. **Issue:** Inconsistent naming in trade log context fields. The `sma_crossover_backtest_with_log` function generates multiple keys for the same concept (e.g., `regime`, `entry_regime`, `EntryRegime`; `volatility`, `entry_volatility`, `EntryVolatility`; `volume`, `entry_volume`, `EntryVolume`, `volume_entry`). This makes accessing these fields later (e.g., in the report generator) confusing and error-prone.
    **Suggested Action:** Standardize the naming convention for all context fields added to the trade log within `sma_crossover_backtest_with_log`. Choose a single, consistent scheme (e.g., always use prefixes like `entry_` and `exit_`, use lowercase with underscores: `entry_regime`, `exit_regime`, `entry_volatility`, `exit_volatility`, `entry_volume`, `exit_volume`, `entry_atr`, `exit_atr`, etc.). Update `report_generator.py` to use these standardized keys.

13. **Issue:** Missing `high` and `low` data usage. The `calculate_atr` function correctly uses `high`, `low`, and `close` if available. However, the primary data fetching in `fetcher.py` and subsequent processing don't seem to explicitly ensure these columns are retained and passed through. The backtesting strategies (`SMACrossover`, `RSIStrategy`) only use `self.data.Close`. This limits the potential for more sophisticated strategies or indicators (like ATR) that rely on High/Low prices.
    **Suggested Action:** Modify `fetch_stock_data` and `clean_and_validate_data` to ensure 'High' and 'Low' columns (case-insensitively matched and converted to lowercase 'high', 'low') are fetched and retained alongside 'close' and 'volume'. Update the backtesting functions (`sma_crossover_backtest_with_log`, etc.) to potentially utilize this data if needed for indicators like ATR or for more realistic price simulation (e.g., assuming entry/exit occurs within the day's range).
