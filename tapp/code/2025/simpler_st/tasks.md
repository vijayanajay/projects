## Epic: Migrate from per-ticker to unified portfolio simulation and reporting

### 1. PRD & Documentation
- [x] Update summary.md after implementation to describe new architecture and file responsibilities (0.5h) (Completed 2025-04-27; summary.md fully up to date)

## Completed Tasks (Portfolio-Level Backtest & Unified Report Refactor)

- [x] Refactored generate_report in report_generator.py to remove the ticker parameter and generate a single portfolio-level report (portfolio_report.pdf). All per-ticker references replaced with portfolio-level naming. (2025-04-27)
- [x] Updated tests in tests/test_report_generation.py and tests/test_pipeline.py to call generate_report and run_pipeline with unified inputs, checking for portfolio_report.pdf and portfolio_equity.png. (2025-04-27)
- [x] Added filtering in pipeline.py to skip invalid tickers (e.g., '', '.', None) before fetching data. (2025-04-27)
- [x] Documented invalid ticker '.' in tech_analysis/data/stocks_list.py. (2025-04-27)
- [x] Unified backtest logic using portfolio_backtest in tech_analysis/backtest.py for multi-ticker portfolio simulation. (2025-04-27)

This ensures visual consistency and clarity throughout the report. Completed using TDD and minimal code, 2025-04-30)
- [x] Overlay SMA indicator with annotations for PDF (TDD, minimal code, 2025-04-29)

- [x] Export: Backtest results exported for reporting (JSON).
- [x] Market Condition Analysis: Criteria defined, regime detection logic implemented, and strategy performance correlated with regimesâ€”all with TDD and tests.
- [x] Summarize regime analysis in PDF report (TDD, minimal code, 2025-04-27)

- [x] Designed PDF template structure (cover, TOC, sections) in code (TDD, minimal code, 2025-04-28)
- [x] Updated test in `tests/test_data_fetcher.py`:
  - Now fetches data for `HCLTECH.NS` instead of `RELIANCE.NS`.
  - Uses a 20-year period for robust data fetching.
  - Added print statement for DataFrame output in the test.
- [x] Created/updated `tech_analysis/data/fetcher.py` for stock data fetching logic.
- [x] Investigated yfinance API changes and error handling for robustness.
- [x] Added and passed tests for data cleaning/validation and Parquet caching.
- [x] Implemented `clean_and_validate_data` and `cache_to_parquet` functions.
- [x] Added and passed test for loading cached Parquet data.
- [x] Implemented `load_from_parquet` function.
- [x] Implemented and tested SMA crossover backtest logic in `tech_analysis/backtest.py` with TDD in `tests/test_backtest_engine.py`. Test now passes and logic matches pandas idioms.
- [x] Implemented and tested RSI strategy backtest logic in `tech_analysis/backtest.py` with TDD in `tests/test_backtest_engine.py`. Test now passes and logic matches pandas idioms.
- [x] Implemented and tested performance metrics calculation (returns, Sharpe, drawdown, win rate) in `tech_analysis/backtest.py` with TDD in `tests/test_backtest_engine.py`. All metrics verified by test.
- [x] Implemented export_backtest_results in `tech_analysis/backtest.py` to export trade logs and metrics to JSON for PDF report generation (TDD, minimal code).
- [x] Defined criteria for market regimes (trending, ranging, volatile, calm) and added TDD-driven logic and tests for regime classification in `market_regimes.py`.
- [x] Implemented market regime detection logic and added TDD-driven logic and tests for regime detection in `market_regimes.py`.
- [x] Correlated strategy performance with detected market regimes and added TDD-driven logic and tests for regime correlation in `market_regimes.py`.
- [x] Created reusable PDF chart component and embedded equity curve in report (TDD, minimal code, 2025-04-27)
- [x] Added placeholder section for Analyst Notes and Suggestions in PDF report template (TDD, minimal code, 2025-04-27)
- [x] Implemented equity curve plotting and embedding in PDF report (TDD, minimal code, 2025-04-27)
- [x] Overlay RSI indicator with annotations for PDF (TDD, minimal code, 2025-04-30)
- [x] Captured and stored trade entry/exit data for PDF report (trade log is now robustly included and displayed in the PDF Trade Log section; TDD, minimal code, 2025-04-27)
- [x] Implemented trade-by-trade log and market context for PDF report (TDD, minimal code, 2025-04-27)
  - Calculated and logged PnL per trade for PDF.
  - Captured market context (trend, volatility, volume) at each trade for PDF.
  - Formatted trade log for PDF inclusion.
- [x] Log indicator values at decision points for PDF (trade log now includes SMA values at entry/exit for each transaction; TDD, minimal code, 2025-04-27)
- [x] Log algorithmic rationale at each transaction for PDF (trade log now includes a human-readable rationale string for each trade; TDD, minimal code, 2025-04-27)
- [x] Visualize metric distributions and highlight outliers in PDF (Added chart to PDF report visualizing performance metric distributions (e.g., returns) and highlighting outliers in red, with annotation and legend. Implemented using TDD and minimal code in report_generator.py and tests/test_report_generation.py. All tests pass and feature is robust to headless environments, 2025-04-27)
- [x] Analyst Notes & Improvement Suggestions section (PDF):
  - 9.1: Designed a visually distinct notes section in the PDF report template with a dedicated area for analyst notes and suggestions. (TDD, minimal code, 2025-04-27)
  - 9.2: Confirmed section is visible and clearly marked in the PDF. Editable fields not required per user. (2025-04-27)
- [x] Implemented portfolio-level backtest function (portfolio_backtest) in tech_analysis/backtest.py: Accepts all stock data, iterates over time, evaluates buy/hold/sell for all stocks, prefers buy if signal and cash available, allocates position size (configurable), no short selling logic, updates holdings/cash, and logs each trade with rationale. Fully TDD-compliant and minimal code added. (2025-04-27)
- [x] All core features for the technical analysis PDF reporting system are complete and fully integrated. The pipeline now:
  - Fetches and cleans data for all stocks in STOCKS_LIST (tech_analysis/data/stocks_list.py)
  - Runs backtest strategies (SMA, RSI) with robust, index-agnostic logic (tech_analysis/backtest.py)
  - Generates visually consistent, sectioned PDF reports with regime summaries, trade logs, and analyst notes (report_generator.py)
  - Orchestrates everything in pipeline.py, now fully standalone and batch-enabled (no user input required)
- [x] All tests pass for data fetching, cleaning, backtesting, metrics, regime analysis, and PDF generation.
- [x] TDD and minimal code principles followed throughout.
- [x] See summary.md for codebase structure and navigation.

## Summary of Completed Work (2025-04-27)
- All code and tests have been refactored for unified, portfolio-level backtesting and reporting.
- Only one PDF report is generated per run, aggregating all tickers.
- All per-ticker logic and references have been removed or updated.
- Defensive filtering prevents invalid tickers from causing runtime errors.
- All tests pass, confirming TDD compliance and minimal code.
