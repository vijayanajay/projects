## Completed Tasks (Portfolio-Level Backtest & Unified Report Refactor)
- All tasks up to 13.4 are complete as of 2025-04-29. See below for details:
- [x] Task 12.1: Trade Statistics Breakdown (2025-04-28)
  - Implemented summary table showing average win, average loss, largest win, largest loss, profit factor, expectancy, and trade breakdown by regime (trending/ranging) in the Markdown report. All metrics are displayed in a clearly separated summary table and regime breakdown. Tests in tests/test_report_generation.py verify presence and correctness. TDD-compliant, minimal code.
- [x] Task 12.2: Position Sizing & Risk Management Details (2025-04-28)
  - The report now documents and displays risk per trade, capital allocation logic, and position sizing method as required. The "Risk and Position Sizing Logic" section explicitly states the % risked per trade, allocation rule, and max simultaneous positions (defaulting to cash-limited if not set). All changes are TDD-verified and minimal. Tests updated to assert new report format. No further action pending.
- [x] Task 12.3: Benchmark Comparison (2025-04-28)
  - Add a section comparing portfolio returns to one or more benchmarks (e.g., NIFTY, S&P 500), including outperformance/underperformance.
  - Acceptance: Table or chart shows portfolio vs. benchmark returns for the same period.
  - Status: Complete
  - Implemented: Markdown report now includes a "Benchmark Comparison" section with a static image chart and table comparing portfolio and benchmark returns, following Kalish Nadh's Markdown visualization philosophy.
