## Epic: Migrate from per-ticker to unified portfolio simulation and reporting

### 1. PRD & Documentation
- [x] Update summary.md after implementation to describe new architecture and file responsibilities (0.5h) (Completed 2025-04-27; summary.md fully up to date)

---

## Summary of Completed Work (2025-04-27)
- All code and tests have been refactored for unified, portfolio-level backtesting and reporting.
- Only one PDF report is generated per run, aggregating all tickers.
- All per-ticker logic and references have been removed or updated.
- Defensive filtering prevents invalid tickers from causing runtime errors.
- All tests pass, confirming TDD compliance and minimal code.
- Pipeline, backtest, and report generation now fully configurable via config.json (period, strategy, cash, position size, etc.).
- Data fetch period defaults to 10 years for robust backtesting; parameters are easily tunable via config file.
- Debug logging included for data quality and parameter visibility.
- See summary.md for codebase structure and navigation.
