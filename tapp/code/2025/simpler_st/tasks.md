## Completed Tasks Summary

- Summarize rationale for PDF report section (trade rationale aggregation and summary now included in PDF, TDD, minimal code, 2025-04-27)
- Standardized PDF visual style and legends (all charts now use a consistent color palette, section headers use bold Arial font, and legends are always present in both charts and PDF captions. This ensures visual consistency and clarity throughout the report. Completed using TDD and minimal code, 2025-04-30)
- Overlay SMA indicator with annotations for PDF (TDD, minimal code, 2025-04-29)
- Data Pipeline: Stock price fetcher, cleaning/validation, Parquet caching, and loading implemented with TDD.
- Backtesting Engine: SMA crossover and RSI strategies, trade execution/logging, and performance metrics (returns, Sharpe, drawdown, win rate) all TDD-verified.
- Export: Backtest results exported for reporting (JSON).
- Market Condition Analysis: Criteria defined, regime detection logic implemented, and strategy performance correlated with regimes—all with TDD and tests.
- Summarize regime analysis in PDF report (TDD, minimal code, 2025-04-27)
- Defined PDF report sections and layout in Markdown outline (2025-04-27)
- Designed PDF template structure (cover, TOC, sections) in code (TDD, minimal code, 2025-04-28)
- Updated test in `tests/test_data_fetcher.py`:
  - Now fetches data for `HCLTECH.NS` instead of `RELIANCE.NS`.
  - Uses a 20-year period for robust data fetching.
  - Added print statement for DataFrame output in the test.
- Created/updated `tech_analysis/data/fetcher.py` for stock data fetching logic.
- Investigated yfinance API changes and error handling for robustness.
- Added and passed tests for data cleaning/validation and Parquet caching.
- Implemented `clean_and_validate_data` and `cache_to_parquet` functions.
- Added and passed test for loading cached Parquet data.
- Implemented `load_from_parquet` function.
- Implemented and tested SMA crossover backtest logic in `tech_analysis/backtest.py` with TDD in `tests/test_backtest_engine.py`. Test now passes and logic matches pandas idioms.
- Implemented and tested RSI strategy backtest logic in `tech_analysis/backtest.py` with TDD in `tests/test_backtest_engine.py`. Test now passes and logic matches pandas idioms.
- Implemented and tested performance metrics calculation (returns, Sharpe, drawdown, win rate) in `tech_analysis/backtest.py` with TDD in `tests/test_backtest_engine.py`. All metrics verified by test.
- Implemented export_backtest_results in `tech_analysis/backtest.py` to export trade logs and metrics to JSON for PDF report generation (TDD, minimal code).
- Defined criteria for market regimes (trending, ranging, volatile, calm) and added TDD-driven logic and tests for regime classification in `market_regimes.py`.
- Implemented market regime detection logic and added TDD-driven logic and tests for regime detection in `market_regimes.py`.
- Correlated strategy performance with detected market regimes and added TDD-driven logic and tests for regime correlation in `market_regimes.py`.
- Created reusable PDF chart component and embedded equity curve in report (TDD, minimal code, 2025-04-27)
- Added placeholder section for Analyst Notes and Suggestions in PDF report template (TDD, minimal code, 2025-04-27)
- Implemented equity curve plotting and embedding in PDF report (TDD, minimal code, 2025-04-27)
- Overlay RSI indicator with annotations for PDF (TDD, minimal code, 2025-04-30)
- Captured and stored trade entry/exit data for PDF report (trade log is now robustly included and displayed in the PDF Trade Log section; TDD, minimal code, 2025-04-27)
- Implemented trade-by-trade log and market context for PDF report (TDD, minimal code, 2025-04-27)
  - Calculated and logged PnL per trade for PDF.
  - Captured market context (trend, volatility, volume) at each trade for PDF.
  - Formatted trade log for PDF inclusion.
- Log indicator values at decision points for PDF (trade log now includes SMA values at entry/exit for each transaction; TDD, minimal code, 2025-04-27)
- Log algorithmic rationale at each transaction for PDF (trade log now includes a human-readable rationale string for each trade; TDD, minimal code, 2025-04-27)
- Visualize metric distributions and highlight outliers in PDF (Added chart to PDF report visualizing performance metric distributions (e.g., returns) and highlighting outliers in red, with annotation and legend. Implemented using TDD and minimal code in report_generator.py and tests/test_report_generation.py. All tests pass and feature is robust to headless environments, 2025-04-27)
- Analyst Notes & Improvement Suggestions section (PDF):
  - 9.1: Designed a visually distinct notes section in the PDF report template with a dedicated area for analyst notes and suggestions. (TDD, minimal code, 2025-04-27)
  - 9.2: Confirmed section is visible and clearly marked in the PDF. Editable fields not required per user. (2025-04-27)
