## New Technical Debt Entry

1.  **Debt Title:** Flaky Test for Timezone Handling in Data Split.
2.  **Unique Identifier:** TD-20231015-001.
3.  **Origin/Context:** This debt arises from the persistent failure in `tests/test_main_timezone_split.py` for `test_main_timezone_handling_in_split`, linked to issues in `main.py` with NaN values and insufficient data in test fixtures, as discussed in the conversation.
4.  **Detailed Description:** The current state has the test failing due to small datasets (e.g., only 2 rows generated) and improper NaN handling, leading to `main.main()` returning None; the ideal state is a reliable test that accurately verifies timezone-aware data splitting without errors; this is technical debt because it indicates underlying code fragility that could propagate to production backtesting logic.
5.  **Impact/Consequences (if not addressed):** Potential undetected bugs in data splitting and feature generation, leading to inaccurate backtest results and increased risk of financial errors in a stock trading application.
6.  **Proposed Rectification (as a well-defined task):**
    *   **Clear Goal:** Ensure the test passes reliably with proper data handling.
    *   **Specific Actionable Steps:** Refactor the test fixture to generate at least 50 rows of data; update `main.py` to enhance NaN safeguards and data sufficiency checks; integrate mocking for edge cases in feature generation.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria / Definition of Done:** The test runs without failures, covers timezone-aware splitting correctly, and achieves 100% pass rate in CI/CD; code changes include updated tests and documentation.
7.  **Estimated Effort/Priority (Optional):** Medium effort; High priority.
