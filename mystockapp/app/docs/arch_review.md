2.  **System Integrity Verdict:**
    The system's architectural integrity concerning both application code and test suite has **SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED**. All previously identified critical flaws have been resolved, including:
    * Incorrect key access in `test_insufficient_cash.py`
    * Function signature mismatch in `test_weekend_split_date.py`
    * Incorrect key access in `test_backtest_edge_cases.py`
    * Misleading test in `test_data_fetching_failure.py`

    Additionally, the implementation of the essential test scenarios has strengthened the verification capabilities of the test suite, providing a more robust foundation for detecting regressions and validating new features.

3.  **Next Steps:**
    *   Continue implementing the strategic architectural imperatives, particularly focusing on standardizing NaN handling across data processing pipelines.
    *   Consider implementing additional integration tests that verify the interaction between different components of the system.
    *   Review the entire test suite for similar patterns of incorrect assumptions about data structures.
    *   Document the correct data structures returned by key functions (like `run_backtest`) to prevent similar issues in the future.
